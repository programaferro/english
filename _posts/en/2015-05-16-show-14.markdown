subtitle: "The Fast and the Furious: Point by Point"
summary: "Every race car driver knows that the specific details of the road make a huge difference in how the driver will navigate that road in a race. The scriptures say that we are in a race. Join us next week as we begin to examine point by point the erroneous pitfalls of a major teaching in the church. A teaching that is blinding Christians to the specific details in the road ahead which will result in terrible consequences. Our ten thousand dollar giveaway continues. Be the first to present one verse or passage of scripture,  as outlined in the first show,  and win."
