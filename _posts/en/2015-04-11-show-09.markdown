title: "Our Resurrection Through The Passover Part 2"
subtitle: "Our Resurrection Through The Passover Part 2"
summary: "Join us as we continue with part 2, and examine how the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus Christ stands as the foundation of the Christian faith. We will see how these events were foretold through specific prophecies as well as through the very feasts that the Jewish people still celebrate to this day. Most Christians know about the passover of the Jewish people in Egypt, but why is Jesus called our passover lamb? What is the significance of the blood on the door posts and the four day examination of the lambs before they were to be slaughtered? Was the Passover created by God as a picture of what Messiah would do, or did the disciples just take the meaning of Passover and conveniently apply it to Jesus? Why did Jesus rise on Sunday? And what day was He crucified...was it really good Friday as the Catholic Church says? We will continue to look at some not so well known reasons why the crucifixion and resurrection are truly based in the Old Testament Scriptures...and why our confidence in the resurrection of Christ should never be shaken."
