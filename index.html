    <h2>They want to talk about WHAT?</h2>
    <p>Join us next week as we present different ideas for future shows that are designed to build your faith and give you reasons to believe.</p>
    <p>Such as issues regarding Biblical prophecy, Jehovah's witnesses and the cults, the fear of God, sharing the gospel, spiritual gifts, salvation, roles of men and women, an expose on the most famous musicians who confess to being possessed by demonic spirits, John Calvin and his impact on the church, marriage and raising children.  Also, Judaism- it's beliefs past and present, replacement theology, how to interpret the bible through the eyes of its Jewish writers, Biblical terms and conditions and much, much more.</p>
