    <h2>The Fast and the Furious: Point by Point</h2>
    
    <p>Every race car driver knows that the specific details of the road make a huge difference in how the driver will navigate that road in a race. The scriptures say that we are in a race. Join us next week as we begin to examine point by point the erroneous pitfalls of a major teaching in the church.</p> 
    
    <p>A teaching that is blinding Christians to the specific details in the road ahead which will result in terrible consequences.</p> 

    <p>Our ten thousand dollar giveaway continues. Be the first to present one verse or passage of scripture, as outlined in the first show, and win.</p>
