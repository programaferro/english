    <h2>The Fast and the Furious: The 10K Giveaway</h2>

    <p>Last week we examined how the most popular belief in the church today is identical to the tragic event that blindsided Paul Walker of the Fast and the Furious movie franchise. Paul heard the warnings but ignored them. And in the same way the church is ignoring the prophetic road signs that speak of danger ahead.</p>

      <p>Be the first to present just one verse from the Bible to prove this major teaching in the church is true and win ten thousand dollars. This week we will look at the historical background for this teaching and begin to examine its beliefs, point by point.</p>
