    <h2>Q&A And The Origins Of The Easter Egg</h2>

    <p>Join us next week as we continue our conclusion of Our Resurrection Through The Passover Of The Jews. We will conclude the study, as well as answer some questions and statements from our listeners.</p>

    <p>Such as, what's the significance of the tearing of the veil in the temple at his death? Why were there angels at the head and feet of where Jesus had been laying?  Can the gospel accounts of His resurrection be trusted because they have different descriptions of what happened that day? What is the source for coloring the Easter eggs in blood and where did the concept of the Easter eggs come from?</p>
